        <p>We are a a group of people who believe that our interactions with technology should promote a healthy development of our skills, knowledge and understanding of others and the world around us. Our time and energy are best spent on developing ourselves, or so we think. Moving away from thoughtlessly using apps because they provide entertainment and stimuli, we want our apps to be considered tools that are available as you interact with the REAL world, not the digital one.</p>
